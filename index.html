      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a previous nomad finally settling down to make the most of her life. I believe everyone is capable of changing the world, and we all have strengths to do so. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born outside of Detroit, Michigan. Before High School I moved to Warner Robins, Georgia. I went to college in Macon, Georgia. Since college, I have lived in Lexington, Kentucy, Flint, Michigan, Alexandria, Virginia, Memphis, Tennessee, and Little Rock, Arkansas before finally settling down for good in Surprise, Arizona. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Besides being a gamer, I enjoy playing music on guitar and cello, writing novels, and video editing. I also love to travel and would love to eventually visit all 50 states as well as many countries as I can. When I travel, I like visiting museums and botanical gardens.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to work for a non profit actively making a difference in making the world a better place. I'd prefer something that lets me work and travel. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I am currently living with my parents, as I am also my father's caretaker. We have a beautiful house in Surprise, Arizona.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always loved working with code, mostly CSS and HTML, to create various small projects for myself. I see more and more use in the world as it evolves for non profits to have a very strong presence on the internet, and I want to work with nonprofits to create these spaces to help them make positive impact on the world.</p>
